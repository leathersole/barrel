= Deploying 3scale to CRC

== Introduction
This document will walk you through the process of installing link:https://www.redhat.com/ja/technologies/jboss-middleware/3scale[Red Hat 3scale API Management], an API management product, on link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/overview[CodeReady Containers], an OpenShift environment running on desktops and laptops.

== Prerequisites
=== System requirements
CRC requires the following system resources:

* 4 virtual CPUs (vCPUs)
* 8 GB of memory
** The procedure on this page recommends that you allocate at least 10GB of memory to the CRC virtual machine, preferably 16GB.
* 35 GB of storage space

Note: For more requirements, refer to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.9/html/getting_started_guide/installation_gsg#minimum-system-requirements_gsg[CRC - Minimum system requirements].

=== Accounts
A Red Hat Developer account is required. For details on how to register, please refer to link:https://developers.redhat.com/[Red Hat Developer] page. 

After registering, create a service account with the link:https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/[Token Generator], then note the username and token.

== My tested environment
* link:https://getfedora.org/[Fedora 31]
* CRC 1.9.0
* OpenShift 4.3.10
* 3scale 2.8

CRC is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, so you can try it in other environments as well.

== Installation procedure
. Download CRC and Pull Secret from link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned[this download page].
. Extract the CRC archive file, then move to the extracted directory.
. `$ ./crc setup`
+
Note:  If you have more memory available on your PC, I recommend increasing the memory allocation. By running `./crc config set memory 16384`, CRC uses 16GB memory.
. `$ ./crc start -p /path/to/pull-secret` +
It will take quite a while, so please be patient. When the following message is output, the CRC has been started.
+

INFO To access the cluster, first set up your environment by following 'crc oc-env' instructions
INFO Then you can access it by running 'oc login -u developer -p developer https://api.crc.testing:6443'
INFO To login as an admin, run 'oc login -u kubeadmin -p HeJWN-ckbCA-Q96Ds-Sj763 https://api.crc.testing:6443' 
INFO                                              
INFO You can now run 'crc console' and use these credentials to access the OpenShift web console
Started the OpenShift cluster
WARN The cluster might report a degraded or error state. This is expected since several operators have been disabled to lower the resource usage. For more information, please consult the documentation 
----
+
The login user, password, connection destination, etc. are printed in the startup message, so please note them. +
After the CRC indicates that the startup is complete, you can access the OpenShift web console. However, in some cases, the startup process is still going on.
. Enable `oc` command.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ eval $(./crc oc-env)
----
. Login to the OpenShift with this command. 
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc login -u kubeadmin -p <password> https://api.crc.testing:6443
----
+
Replace `<password>` with the generated password.
. Create a project (e.g. 3scale28)
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc new-project 3scale28
----
+
. Create `threescale-registry-auth` secret in the project
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc create secret docker-registry threescale-registry-auth \
 --docker-server=registry.redhat.io \
 --docker-username="your-registry-service-account-username" \
 --docker-password="your-registry-service-account-password"
----
. Run `$ crc console` to open the OpenShift web console.
+

. Select Administrator view.
. Open OperatorHub.
. Search "3scale".
. Click `Red Hat Integration - 3scale`
. Click `Install` button.
. Select a project to install the operator, a 3scale version, enable/disable auto update. Click `Subscribe` button.
+
image:select_install_options.png[Select Install Options]
. Click the operator, then click `Create Instance` in API Manager box.
. Edit API Manager definition as following, then click `Create`.

. Once all the pods have been rolled out, access the 3scale admin portal.
** 3scale admin portal: https://3scale-admin.apps-crc.testing/
** Check `ADMIN_USER` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the `system-seed` secret for your ID and password.
*** https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing/k8s/ns/3scale28/secrets/system-seed
** Other Routes

== Troubleshooting
=== OperatorHub page shows "No OperatorHub Items Found"
Wait for a while. The feature might not be ready yet.

This document may help. +
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-marketplace/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#no-packages-show-up-in-the-ui-no-operatorhub-items-found[No packages show up in the UI (No OperatorHub Items Found)]

=== 3scale Operator is running, but no pods are rolled out.
* Confirm whether `threescale-registry-auth` secret is created with the correct values.

=== Cannot start CRC
Try these operations:

* `$ ./crc stop`
* `$ ./crc delete`
* Remove the crc VM

After that, back to `crc setup`.

=== How to setup previous OCP versions
If you need to run previous OCP versions, you can download the corresponding CRC from here: +
https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/crc/
