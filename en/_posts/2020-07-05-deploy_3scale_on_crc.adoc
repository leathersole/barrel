= Deploying 3scale to OpenShift Local

== Introduction
This document will walk you through the process of installing link:https://www.redhat.com/ja/technologies/jboss-middleware/3scale[Red Hat 3scale API Management], an API management product, on link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview[OpenShift Local], an OpenShift environment running on desktops and laptops.

== Prerequisites
=== System requirements
OpenShift Local requires the following system resources:

* 4 virtual CPUs (vCPUs)
* 9 GB of memory
** The procedure on this page recommends that you allocate at least 10GB of memory to the OpenShift Local virtual machine, preferably 16GB.
* 35 GB of storage space

[.notice]
NOTE: For more requirements, refer to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_local/2.23/html/getting_started_guide/installing#minimum_system_requirements[OpenShift Local - Minimum system requirements].

=== Accounts
A Red Hat Developer account is required. For details on how to register, please refer to link:https://developers.redhat.com/[Red Hat Developer] page. 

== My tested environment
* link:https://getfedora.org/[Fedora 38]
* OpenShift Local 2.23.0
* OpenShift 4.13.3
* 3scale 2.13

OpenShift Local is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, so you can try it in other environments as well.

== Installation procedure
. Download OpenShift Local and Pull Secret from link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/local[this download page].
. Extract the OpenShift Local archive file, move to the extracted directory, then run this command.
. `$ ./crc setup`
+
[.notice]
NOTE:  If you have more memory available on your PC, I recommend increasing the memory allocation. By running `./crc config set memory 16384`, OpenShift Local will use 16GB memory.
+
[.notice]
NOTE:  The command name comes from CodeReady Containers, the former product name of OpenShift Local.
+
. `$ ./crc start -p /path/to/pull-secret` +
It will take quite a while, so please be patient. When the following message is output, the OpenShift Local has been started.

Started the OpenShift cluster.

The server is accessible via web console at:
  https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing

Log in as administrator:
  Username: kubeadmin
  Password: <password>

Log in as user:
  Username: developer
  Password: developer

Use the 'oc' command line interface:
  $ eval $(crc oc-env)
  $ oc login -u developer https://api.crc.testing:6443
----
+
The login user, password, connection destination, etc. are printed in the startup message, so please note them. +
After the OpenShift Local indicates that the startup is complete, you can access the OpenShift web console. However, in some cases, the startup process is still going on.
. Enable `oc` command.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ eval $(./crc oc-env)
----
. Login to the OpenShift with this command. 
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc login -u kubeadmin -p <password> https://api.crc.testing:6443
----
+
Replace `<password>` with the generated password.
. Create a project (e.g. 3scale)
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc new-project 3scale
----
+
. Run `$ crc console` to open the OpenShift web console.
+

. Select Administrator view.
. Open OperatorHub.
. Search "3scale".
. Click `Red Hat Integration - 3scale`
. Click `Install` button.
. Select a project to install the operator, a 3scale version, enable/disable auto update. Click `Install` button.
+

. Click the operator, click `APIManager` tab, then click `Create APIManager`.
. Select `YAML view`, edit APIManager definition as following, then click `Create`.

. Once all the pods have been rolled out, access the 3scale admin portal.
** 3scale admin portal: https://3scale-admin.apps-crc.testing/
** Check `ADMIN_USER` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the `system-seed` secret for your ID and password.
*** https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing/k8s/ns/3scale/secrets/system-seed
** Other Routes

== Troubleshooting
=== OperatorHub page shows "No OperatorHub Items Found"
Wait for a while. The feature might not be ready yet.

This document may help. +
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-marketplace/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#no-packages-show-up-in-the-ui-no-operatorhub-items-found[No packages show up in the UI (No OperatorHub Items Found)]

=== 3scale Operator is running, but no pods are rolled out.
* Confirm whether `threescale-registry-auth` secret is created with the correct values.

=== Cannot start OpenShift Local
Try these operations:

* `$ ./crc stop`
* `$ ./crc delete`
* Remove the crc VM

After that, back to `crc setup`.

=== How to setup previous OCP versions
If you need to run previous OCP versions, you can download the corresponding OpenShift Local from here: +
